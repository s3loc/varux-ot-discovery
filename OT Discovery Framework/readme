### üìò **README ‚Äî VARUX OT Discovery Framework**

---

#### **Project Overview**

**VARUX OT Discovery Framework** is a next-generation industrial (OT) network discovery and topology intelligence system developed by **s3loc (Selman Vural)** under **VARUX Dynamic Research Labs**.
It is designed to **map**, **monitor**, and **analyze** operational technology environments with **passive**, **read-only**, and **rate-limited** intelligence modules‚Äîensuring complete compliance and zero disruption to live industrial systems.

This framework integrates advanced modules for:

* **Passive network discovery (SPAN/TAP monitoring)**
* **SNMPv3 authPriv-secured device enumeration (MD5/SHA + AES)**
* **LLDP/CDP-based topology reconstruction**
* **Modbus/TCP asset identification**
* **Log rotation and secure audit trail with cryptographic signatures**
* **SIEM & ELK integration for centralized telemetry**
* **Adaptive rate-limiting and exponential retry/backoff control**
* **Encrypted credential vault & secure configuration management**

#### **Key Features**

| Category               | Description                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Discovery Engine**   | Passive and semi-active asset identification with protocol-aware fingerprinting (SNMP, Modbus, LLDP, ICMP, ARP). |
| **Topology Mapping**   | Graph-based LLDP parser generating network relationship graphs using Graphviz.                                   |
| **Logging & Security** | Masked, rotating log system with archive compression, PII masking, and journal integration.                      |
| **Audit Trail**        | Every discovery session is digitally signed (RSA 2048) and timestamp-verified.                                   |
| **Credential Vault**   | Optional HashiCorp Vault and environment-variable-based credential isolation.                                    |
| **SIEM Bridge**        | Supports JSON, CEF, LEEF, and Splunk HTTP Collector formats.                                                     |
| **Resource Safety**    | Enforced CPU/RAM/file-descriptor ceilings to protect embedded systems.                                           |
| **Compliance Ready**   | Structured for IEC 62443, NIST 800-82, and ISO 27019 alignment.                                                  |

#### **Installation**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/varux/ot-discovery-framework.git
cd ot-discovery-framework
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Run only within authorized, isolated lab or scoped enterprise networks.*

---

#### **Usage**

```bash
sudo python3 VARUX_OT_Discovery_Framework.py --range 192.168.1.0/24 --rps 1.0 --snmpv3
```

* Default configuration: `config/elite_config.yaml`
* Output data: `elite_discovery_outputs/` (JSON, SVG, Reports)
* Logs: `/var/log/industrial_discovery/`
* Dashboard (optional): [http://localhost:8050](http://localhost:8050)

---

#### **Configuration**

The framework supports **YAML** or **JSON** configuration files with environment-variable substitution:

```yaml
snmpv3_users:
  - username: discovery
    auth_protocol: SHA
    auth_key: ${SNMPV3_AUTH_KEY}
    priv_protocol: AES
    priv_key: ${SNMPV3_PRIV_KEY}
```

Sensitive values are never stored in plain text. Logs automatically mask keys, credentials, and tokens.

#### **Legal & Ethical Notice**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Strict Legal Compliance Required**

This software is created **exclusively for authorized security auditing, asset discovery, and compliance verification** in **networks where explicit written consent** has been granted.
Any use, deployment, or distribution **outside of approved scopes** constitutes **unauthorized activity** and may violate:

* **Turkish Penal Code 5651 & 5237**,
* **EU Cybercrime Directive 2013/40/EU**,
* **U.S. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1030)**,
* and other international cybersecurity laws.

**VARUX Dynamic Labs** and its contributors disclaim any liability for misuse.
Use of this framework implies acceptance of all compliance and ethics conditions.

---

#### **Security & Privacy**

* All data collected during scans is **read-only** and **non-destructive**.
* Sensitive outputs (credentials, hashes, tokens) are automatically masked in logs.
* Audit logs are **digitally signed** and can be **verified** for chain-of-custody assurance.
* Configurable retention and encryption policies prevent data leakage.
